# Design Guidelines
- Games should have individual components for tutorial because the game
  mechanics may vary greatly, it may be difficult to keep it consistent
  to a fixed format as they may require different screen real estate
  and specific visual animations.
- Tutorial for games should exist on the splash screen.
- Game flow: Title screen => Tutorial (Carousel) => Game.

# Development Strategy
I am opening the development site to public from the get-go. Building it
as rough as possible and move on as long as it's usable. Adventure mode
is low on priority, I will focus on pushing out 5 refined methods first.
Will be using a dataset of 100 occupations.

# Development Priorities
1. User access
  > I should just implement a dummy user flow, nothing is logged.
