# Development Strategy
I am opening the development site to public from the get-go. Building it
as rough as possible and move on as long as it's usable. Adventure mode
is low on priority, I will focus on pushing out 5 refined methods first.
Will be using a dataset of 100 occupations.

# Development Priorities
1. User access
  > I should just implement a dummy user flow, nothing is logged.
